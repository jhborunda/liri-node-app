This assignment allowed me to gain more knowledge on NodeJS and also gave me the ability to get more familiar with NPM and the associated items that had to be NPM-Installed. What I learned from class is that Node.JS "is an open source, cross-platorm JavaZScript runtime environment designed to be run outside of browsers."
